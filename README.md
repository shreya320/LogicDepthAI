# LogicDepthAI
This project leverages AI to predict the combinational logic depth of signals in behavioral RTL without running a complete synthesis. Using a Random Forest model trained on RTL signal features such as Fan-In, Fan-Out, gate count, and module complexity, the solution provides a faster, data-driven approach to estimate logic depth.
